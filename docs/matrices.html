<h1>Homogeneous Matrices and Coordinate System</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    TL;DR the upper 3 slots of the right-most column in the matrix are used for translation or moving the the model around,
    adding values here is equivalent to using WASDCSPACE to adjust the models position. The bottom row is used for altering 
    W coordinate, this will affect the translation speed and the perspective of the model in likely undesirable ways. It 
    is probable this will damage the rasterizers ability to perform accurate depth testing resulting in visual artifacts.

    Homogeneous matrices are used to perform transformations on vertex data, this is the basis for moving models around,
    performing rotations, and applying perspective. The term Homogeneous refers to this systems ability to combine linear
    affine and non-linear operations all into the framework of linear algebra.

    3D coordinates traditionally use an X, Y and Z value to describe their location in relation to each axis, and each
    coordinate adds a dimension, using only an X coordinate we can represent a line, using an X and Y we can represent
    a plane and with an X, Y and Z we can represent 3D space. The Homogeneous coordinate system uses an additional value
    referred to as the W coordinate, this however, does not represent a higher dimension. The goal of the homoegeneous 
    coordinate system is to allow operations that exist outside of the scope of linear algebra, namely translation and 
    projection.

    The W coordinate is initially assumed to be 1.0, this value does not hold any significance but rather has valuable 
    utility in the existing framework of linear algebra, which is being extended here.

    Given the homogeneous coordinates [X, Y, Z, W], the translation operation using a homogeneous matrix is as follows:

    [1, 0, 0, tX]
    [0, 1, 0, tY]
    [0, 0, 1, tZ]
    [0, 0, 0, 1]

    Multiplying this matrix by the coordinates results in:

    X*1 + Y*0 + Z*0 + W*tX = X + tX = rX
    X*0 + Y*1 + Z*0 + W*tY = Y + tY = rY
    X*0 + Y*0 + Z*1 + W*tZ = Z + tZ = rZ
    X*0 + Y*0 + Z*0 + W*1 = W = rW

    The resulting coordinates are [rX, rY, rZ, rW].

    As you can see the affect of the translation matrix is equivalent to adding the desired translation to the corresponding
    coordinate (one might think this is more computationally efficient, and they may be right, see my analysis here:
    <a href="matricesInAsm.html">compiler optimizations of matrix operations</a>, however, there is value in maintaining consistent methodology in operations
    in a codebase)

    Translation is not considered a linear transformation because the origin would not be preserved, it also would be 
    translated, translation is considered an affine transformation, meaning ratios and parallel lines are preserved 
    (keep in mind all linear operations are also affine, not all affine operations are linear).

    The other use of the W coordinate is in the perspective projection matrix, which is neither linear nor affine
    as it will not preserve the origin or parallelism and ratios.

    The perspective projection is significantly more complex than any other transform that occurs and it makes the most
    use of the W coordinate.

    The goal of the perspective projection matrix is to create the illusion of human perspective in a scene, this mainly 
    works by altering the vector space to form a frustum. A frustum is a shape, best thought of as a truncated pyramid, 
    think of a pyramid with the tip removed, this idea approximates a human's field of view, meaning objects more on the 
    peripherals of the view are more likely to be included the further away they are. In the demo, try moving the model 
    to the left or right as you move it further away, you'll see that the object can stay in view even if moved greatly 
    to one side as long as it is moved back enough, this is comparable to how humans perceive objects.
    
    The matrix is as follows:

    FOV = field of view, or the width of the viewport, expressed as an angle.
    AR = aspect ratio, or the ratio between the height and width of the scene.
    FP = far plane, or the furthest renderable distance.
    NP = near plane, or the nearest renderable distance.

    [(1.0 / tan(FOV / 2.0f)) - AR, 0,                       0,                  0]
    [0,                            (1.0 / tan(FOV / 2.0f)), 0,                  0]
    [0,                            0,                       FP + NP/(FP - NP), -2 * (FP * NP) / (FP - NP)]
    [0,                            0,                       1,                  0]

    Deriving this matrix is pretty heavy stuff and more than what I want to get into here. There are also several
    variations of this matrix with similar outputs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqNcqBdrNyI">this guy offers a good explanation.</a>

    What I want to direct your attention to is the last row of this matrix which contains a 1 in 3rd column,
    the result of this is that the resulting vectors W value will be an unaltered Z coordinate. Keep in mind that
    this is the last transformation to occur in the graphics engine. This is where we really extend the framework of
    linear algebra beyond what it does traditionally. 

    This unaltered Z coordinate is used for "perspective division", where we divide our final X, Y and Z coordinates 
    by our W coordinate (which is the pre-perspective Z coordinate). This operation results in objects getting scaled
    based on their depth, making further away objects smaller, this is the final step in creating an illusion of perspective
    and making the scene approximate human perception.

    As you can see the W coordinate provides a valuable extension to the framework of linear algebra, this demo offers
    the ability to mess with it by submitting matrices with values in the last row or column, I encourage you to mess with
    this but it will likely provide undesirable results. The 9 values that would form a standard 3x3 matrix can be used
    for some transforms that will likely be more fun and exciting.
