<h1>Exploding a Model</h1>
<pre>
    Despite the rather drastic effect this has on the model, exploding is a fairly straightforward and easy to
    implement operation. The idea behind it is that you multiply a triangle's <a href="normals.html">normal vector</a>
    by a scalar, which is determined by the the slider and defaulted to 0, then add the resulting vector component wise
    to the coordinate vector while ignoring <a href="matrices.html">homogeneous coordinates</a>.

    given coordinate vector [X, Y, Z] and normal vector [NX, NY, NZ] and scalar S the operation is as follows:

    X = X + (NX * S)
    Y = Y + (NY * S)
    Z = Z + (ZY * S)

    Negative scalars are also totally valid, and doing so will cause the <a href="lighting.html">lighting</a>
    to become inverted, which is cool.
