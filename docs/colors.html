<h1>RGB Values</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    RGB values are how colors are represented in the engine. Every triangle in the model has an associated
    red, green and blue value. Using a combonation of these three colors at various levels one can create any color 
    imaginable. These colors are represented as unsigned 8-bit integers, meaning they can represent any value from 
    0 to 255.

    Values are clamped, meaning if a value greater than 255 or less than 0 is entered it will just be set to the respective
    minimum or maximum value.
