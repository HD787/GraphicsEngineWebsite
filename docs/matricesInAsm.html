<h1>Computational Efficiency of Matrices</h1>
<pre>
    Note: this article has pretty much nothing to do with the graphics engine demo.

    It is true that matrices introduce lots of operations, many of which are inconsequential, and 
    it begs the question on whether the consistency in approach they offer is worth it compared to 
    using alternatives, such as deconstructing them to essential operations or something like quaternions.
    Here I will analyze whether clang, the compiler used in this demo can effectively reduce the amount of operations
    used in its output, which will be in ARM64.

    To demonstrate this idea i've prepared this sample code to demonstrate the compilers ability to optimize.
    <code>
        int main(){
            volatile float matrix[16];
            volatile float v1 = 5.0;
            volatile float v2 = 6.0;
            volatile float v3 = 7.0;
            volatile float v4 = 8.0;
        
            matrix[0] = 1.0f;    matrix[1] = 0.0f;   matrix[2] = 0.0f;    matrix[3] = 2.0;
            matrix[4] = 0.0f;    matrix[5] = 1.0f;   matrix[6] = 0.0f;    matrix[7] = 3.0;
            matrix[8] = 0.0f;    matrix[9] = 0.0f;   matrix[10] = 1.0f;   matrix[11] = 4.0;
            matrix[12] = 0.0f;   matrix[13] = 0.0f;  matrix[14] = 0.0f;   matrix[15] = 1.0f;
            volatile float x = v1 * matrix[0] + v2 * matrix[1] + v3 * matrix[2] + v4 * matrix[3];
            volatile float y = v1 * matrix[4] + v2 * matrix[5] + v3 * matrix[6] + v4 * matrix[7];
            volatile float z = v1 * matrix[8] + v2 * matrix[9] + v3 * matrix[10] + v4 * matrix[11];
            volatile float w = v1 * matrix[12] + v2 * matrix[13] + v3 * matrix[14] + v4 * matrix[15];
            volatile float xr = x;
            volatile float xy = y;
            volatile float xz = z;
            volatile float xw = w;
        }
    </code>

    This shows a simple translation matrix by vector multiplication, different values are used to prevent the
    compiler from overfitting this code and reusing values in a way that wouldn't be realistic, also the volatile
    keyword prevents the compiler from deleting code it deems unecessary, in the highest optimization setting 
    Clang would determine none of this code is important and delete it all, which is funny.

    this first program was built like so: "clang -S matrixAsm.c -o matrixAsm.s" no optimization setting defaults
    to -O0

    my annotions will be all caps to differentiate from clang's

    as we can see the Clang with no optimizations pretty faithfully generated our code, lots of redundant operations. 
    
    Next is the code generated with this command: "clang -S matrixAsm.c -o matrixAsm3.s -O3" which signifies maximum
    optimization, also it encourages the use of SIMD if it can figure out how to do so.

    I am surprised that clang found no ways to speed this up other than using integer registers and using registers 
    a little less sparingly, this is still a very faithful generation of code and I expected better.

    In order to get clang to trim code it deems unecessary we need to make a small change to the source code.

    <code>
        int main(){
            float matrix[16];
            volatile float v1 = 5.0;
            volatile float v2 = 6.0;
            volatile float v3 = 7.0;
            volatile float v4 = 8.0;
        
            matrix[0] = 1.0f;    matrix[1] = 0.0f;   matrix[2] = 0.0f;    matrix[3] = 2.0;
            matrix[4] = 0.0f;    matrix[5] = 1.0f;   matrix[6] = 0.0f;    matrix[7] = 3.0;
            matrix[8] = 0.0f;    matrix[9] = 0.0f;   matrix[10] = 1.0f;   matrix[11] = 4.0;
            matrix[12] = 0.0f;   matrix[13] = 0.0f;  matrix[14] = 0.0f;   matrix[15] = 1.0f;
            float x = v1 * matrix[0] + v2 * matrix[1] + v3 * matrix[2] + v4 * matrix[3];
            float y = v1 * matrix[4] + v2 * matrix[5] + v3 * matrix[6] + v4 * matrix[7];
            float z = v1 * matrix[8] + v2 * matrix[9] + v3 * matrix[10] + v4 * matrix[11];

    the difference is the volatile keyword has been removed from the matrix array, this will allow it to remove
    values, I'm keeping on the other volatile keywords to prevent clang from deleting my program altogether.

    All in all it appears that either clang is not able to remove redundant operations or I am unable to create
    the circumstances in which it will, in all cases our source code was pretty faithfully followed. It would stand to 
    reason that using either quaternions or deconstructed matrices will provide more computational efficiency, I wrote
    this article and analyzed the assembly simultaneously so I am pretty dissapointed by this outcome. All this being 
    discovered the gains provided by using more computationally efficient transforms would be marginal at best, that 
    being said marginal gains can grow pretty rapidly when larger scenes or models are rendered, as each transform gets 
    performed on each triangle, in this demo the larger forest model is about 11,000 triangles, this is on the low end 
    compared to many modern 3D models.
