<h1>Normal Vectors</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    Normal vectors play a very important role in graphics operations. The basic building block of a 3D model,
    especially in this engine, is the triangle. As other shapes can be used triangles are ideal because they 
    always form a plane, as a result of this modern hardware has been designed to be especially adept at performing
    triangle operations. Normal vectors are vectors that are perpendicular to the planes formed by the triangle, and 
    every triangle has an associated normal vector. These vectors are incredibly useful in a variety of different
    operation, see <a href="lighting.html">Lighting Vectors</a> and <a href="explode.html">Exploding Models</a>.

    The normal vector is fairly straightforward to produce, by taking two vertices on each triangle, the resulting 
    cross product will be the normal vector.

    The formula for the cross product is as follows:

    given two vectors representing the vertices(keep in mind the <a href="matrices.html">homogeneous W coordinate is excluded here</a>):

    [X1, Y1, Z1] and [X2, Y2, Z2]

    the normal vector [XN, YN, ZN] is calculated like so:

    XN = (Y1 - Z2) * (Z1 - Y2)
    YN = (Z1 - X2) * (X1 - Z2)
    ZN = (X1 - Y2) * (Y1 - X2)

    Keep in mind that the cross product only maintains its useful properties in 3 Dimensions<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-dimensional_cross_product">(and 7????)</a>,
    meaning there is no 2D equivalent.
