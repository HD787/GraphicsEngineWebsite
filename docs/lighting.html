    Lighting implementations vary in complexity, this is one of the simplest. The first step is to normalize the 
    lighting vector, meaning without altering the direction of the vector making it so it has a magnitude of 1.
    In this demo if you enter a non-normalized vector it is automatically normalized. The operation to determine if 
    how directly a triangle is facing in the direction of this vector to perform a dot product with the normalized 
    lighting vector and a normalized <a href="normals.html">normal vector</a>. The result of this operation is a 
    single value between -1 and 1, a result of 1 means that the vectors are antiparallel, or facing eachother directly,
    indicating most direct light, and a result of -1 means they are opposite, facing directly apart, indicating no light.

    The result of the dot product is then incremented by 1, meaning it is now in a range of 0 to 2. The final step 
    is to multiply this value by all of the <a href="colors.html">RGB Values</a>. meaning if a triangle is faced opposite
    it becomes black with RGB values of 0, 0 and 0. If the triangle is antiparallel the RGB values are doubled, which increases
    the brightness.

    The operations for this are as follows with light vector [l1, l2, l3] and normal vector [n1, n2, n3]

    dot product:

    result = (l1 * n1) + (l2 * n2) + (l3 * n3)

    RGB values are altered like so:

    R = R * (result + 1)
    G = G * (result + 1)
    B = B * (result + 1)

    note: RGB values are unsigned 8-bit integers meaning they cannot represent values greater than 255 or less than 0,
    meaning the effectiveness of this operation may be limited as starting values approach these edge values.
    also values are clamped to avoid the dangers of overflow.
