This is currently being hosted at [henryderrick.com](http://henryderrick.com).

it can also be ran by cloning this repository, running a web server with the cloned directory as the root, and navigate to render.html.

the easiest way to do this (probably) is with python's built in web server, if python3 is already installed just run "python3 -m http.server" from the cloned 
directory and select render.html in the browser window from localhost at the specified port, which I believe is 8080 by default.
